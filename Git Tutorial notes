These are the notes, I will be taking from the Git & Github Tutorial from Faraday

Git 
  version control sytsem 
   a version control system let you see all the chnages you make in code over time 
   note: git is NOT github
    git hub is website that stores all your repositories 

CLI - Commond line interface
  where you text commands and run them

Repository 
  folder where you store in your code

Git commands 
  all of these start with "git <command>"
    clone- brings repository that it hosted someehre (e.g Github) into a directory on your machine 

    add- Tracks your files "captures" changes you've made so that you can commit then 

    commit- saves files in Git 
      *you must have a comment that descirbes the change you are committing e.g git commit <file> -m 'added a comma'
      *note: committing doesn't add 

    push- uploads your commits to the remote host like Github 
          You need an SSH key for this to work 
            once you create it, you can dind your key using a number of commands:
             grep, cat, find 
          You must config your key and add it to the SSH agent 
          Then you need a personal token because github removed support for password authentification Aug 2021
      To create personal token:
        go to settings on profile 
        Developer seetings
        generate personal token

    pull - downlaod changes from remote repo (repository) to your machine  

    status- used to determine any changes you've made in repo
